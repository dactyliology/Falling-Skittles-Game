GAME INSTRUCTIONS

In this game, colored Skittle candies and vegetable broccoli rain down from the top of the screen. The objective of 
the game is to collect as many skittles as you can (but avoiding the broccoli) by using the left and right arrow keys
to move the orange bucket. 

Skittles increases the player score by 10 points while broccoli florets decrease the score by 10 points. There is no
penalty for failing to collect skittles.

In every round, the player starts off with 5 lives and loses a life each time a broccoli floret is collected. The 
game terminates when the player runs out of lives.

Immediate feedback for the player is given through the console window; make sure to position the game and console 
windows accordingly.  

High scores are saved to a .txt file and will be updated when a new high score is reached. Even after the application
has been closed, high scores will be available for the next execution of the game.

At the end of the game, the player's time alive and score are displayed to the screen.

Good luck and have fun! :)


**NOTES**
-If a falling object (skittle or vegetable) touches the SIDE of a bucket, it will be collected.


*******FUTURE DIRECTIONS*********
-Custom text class
-Title screen with main menu
-Leaderboard function (maybe online w/ networking?)
-More readable functional decomposition (higher cohesion, lower coupling)
	-set textures inside of object constructor
-Graphically display remaining lives on screen
-Better boundary sensitivity
-Level increments / varied difficulty (higher levels = faster falling skittles)
-Exceptions: display some message to the console if user exits game early
-Different game modes
-Loop the game back to the main menu after dying
